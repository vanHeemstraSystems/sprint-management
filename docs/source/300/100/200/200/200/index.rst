Create Daily Standup Events in Microsoft Teams
===============================================

In Microsoft Teams, from the Calendar tab, choose "New event".

Make sure you select the calendar of the team you are creating a Sprint event for (e.g. Team IT 1: DS Cloud) which you created earlier.

Name the Daily Standup "Team" + blank space + "DEPARTMENT NAME" + "TEAM NUMBER" + ":" + blank space+ "SERVICE NAME" + blank space + "NICKNAME".

Where:

- "DEPARTMENT NAME": the name of the department the team is part of, e.g. for "Information Technology" us "IT".
- "TEAM NUMBER": the number of the team for easy of distinguishing between teams.
- "SERVICE NAME": the service the department of which team is part of e.g. for "Developer Services" use "DS".
- "NICKNAME": the name the team uses to be called. For e.g. a Cloud-technology oriented team, use "Cloud".

Example: Team IT 1: DS Cloud

Set the Start Date to the first day of the Sprint and set a Start and End Time somewhere during each working day (preferably lasting for 15 minutes). Choose for the event to be a repeating event on a weekly basis, including Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. 

If the time of the Daily Standup does not change during Sprints, you can set the End Date to the very end of the last Sprint of the Year. Otherwise set the End Date to the last day of the last Sprint of the Quarter.

Note: This is NOT and "All day" event.

Recommended: Good practise is to hold your Daily Standup in the morning, say from 10:00 AM to 10:15 AM, so all team members can attend (either physically or online).

The Daily Standup's purpose it to verify if the Sprint Goal is still achievable, or if measures need to be taken to remove impediments or obstacles. 

It is also a good time for offering help between Team Members or asking for help by Team Members. 

The Product Owner can be asked to be present for clarification of the work. 

The Scrum Master leads the Daily Standup.

The Calendar Event of the Daily Standup could have directions to the physical meeting place or a link online meeting for ease of attending.
