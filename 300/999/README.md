The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.

> As a [persona], I want [feature], so that [outcome].

So why do I write my sprint goals as user stories? In short, because the team is very familiar with user stories and they capture the outcome weâ€™re after while still allowing us to pivot mid-sprint to meet our goal. We use planning poker to ensure everyone gets a say and feels not just that they have the safety to participate but also the opportunity.
