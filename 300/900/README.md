The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.

> As a [persona], I want [feature], so that [outcome].

So why do I write my sprint goals as user stories? In short, because the team is very familiar with user stories and they capture the outcome weâ€™re after while still allowing us to pivot mid-sprint to meet our goal. We use planning poker to ensure everyone gets a say and feels not just that they have the safety to participate but also the opportunity.

The team may not succeed in all their finite goals, but they will learn valuable lessons that will still take them closer to the just cause.
